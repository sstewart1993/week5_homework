### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

# card.value should have a ==
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
# else needs a : at the end
    else
      return False
   

# dif should be def also no , between card1 and card2
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # if/else statement should be indented from the def function
  if card1.value > card2.value:
# card is not defined should be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# indentations aren't correct
def cards_total(self, cards):
#  total is not defined
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
